# Open Wearable Cardiac Defibrillator (OWCD)

OWCD is an open-source project that provides an implementation of a wearable external cardiac defibrillator. The project is designed to be cross-platform and is intended to be at least as effective as commercially available defibrillators. 

## Project Goals

The goal of the OWCD project is to create an open-source, wearable defibrillator that is both effective and accessible. By making the schematics and source code available, we hope to enable anyone interested in developing a defibrillator to do so without the need for expensive proprietary components. 

## Implementation

The OWCD project provides schematics, source code, and a user manual that describes the steps required to implement the defibrillator. The project utilizes a variety of open-source defibrillator schematics as a starting point, adapting them to create a wearable version. The resulting circuit includes an amplifier circuit, microcontroller, and user interface, among other components. 

## Validation

To validate the OWCD defibrillator, we provide a test protocol, test machine schematic, and test algorithm. The validation process ensures that the defibrillator is functioning correctly and is safe to use. We encourage users to follow the validation process carefully to ensure that their implementation is effective and safe.

## Contributing

The OWCD project is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community. We encourage those interested in contributing to read the contributing guidelines in the project documentation. Contributions can take many forms, from code contributions to suggestions for improvement or bug reports. 

## References

The OWCD project includes a list of references from the literature to support the project. These references include research papers, textbooks, and other relevant sources. By including these references, we hope to provide a solid foundation for those interested in learning more about defibrillators and the scientific principles that underpin their operation.
